\chapter{Conclusion}
The project successfully achieved its main objectives, with the exception of the complete implementation of interrupt handling. It demonstrated the integration of analog signal acquisition, real-time processing, and state-machine (FSM) control on the Nucleo C031C6 microcontroller.
The developed system enabled continuous monitoring of the analog signal through polling, the generation of different filtered signal representations (RAW, NOISE, and Moving Average), and their real-time visualization via the UART interface.

Although the external interrupt handling was not fully completed as expected, the work carried out contributed to developing a deeper understanding of GPIO peripheral configuration and the internal mechanisms of the STM32 HAL library.
