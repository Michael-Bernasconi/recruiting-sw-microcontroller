\chapter{Problems and Solution}

The development of the project involved addressing various challenges at both hardware and software levels. The main issues encountered and the solutions implemented are described below.

\section{Replacement of the Hall Sensor}
As mentioned in previous chapters, the Hall sensor originally intended for both analog and digital acquisition exhibited a persistent malfunction.
To ensure the continuation of the project and preserve its overall logic, the sensor was replaced with:
\begin{itemize}
\item a \textbf{potentiometer} for analog signal acquisition;
\item a \textbf{push button} for managing the digital event.
\end{itemize}

\section{Configuration of the UART2 Peripheral}
During the setup of the serial communication, an issue emerged: the \textbf{UART2} peripheral was initially allocated by the Board Support Package (BSP), preventing its reconfiguration through standard HAL functions.

The solution was identified by reviewing technical documentation and consulting online resources, particularly the website \textit{deepbluembedded.com}, which provided guidance on correctly relocating and initializing the UART peripheral.
Once the peripheral was freed from the BSP configuration, the serial communication was successfully set up.

\section{Interrupt Handling and Missing Digital Plot}
Another difficulty was encountered in handling the interrupt generated by the dedicated push button.
Despite implementing the \texttt{HAL\_GPIO\_EXTI\_Callback()} function and correctly configuring the pin, the digital signal was not detected reliably.
Various resources and references were consulted, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item STM32 and HAL technical documentation,
\item online guides and tutorials (\textit{deepbluembedded.com}),
\item discussions on \textit{StackOverflow},
\item support via \textit{ChatGPT}.
\end{itemize}
